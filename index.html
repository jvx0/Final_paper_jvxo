    <h2>Analysis of mood in <i>Metal Gear Solid 4</i></h2>
  <br>On this website, I will be talking about how music and visuals work together in the videogame <i>Metal Gear Solid 4</i> to evoke a powerful mood.</br>
    <p class="big">
      <br>For a bit of context for the video below, past games had you play as Solid Snake, the main protagonist. 
      In those games, players saw him as a young and strong soldier taking on high risk missions to prevent world domination from corrupted forces.
      He tackles these missions with determination and accomplishes them even when the odds were against him. The game accompanied these missions with an epic and thrilling score for tense and difficult situations
      the player may find themselves in. But while on those missions, he was also subject to witnessing deaths and tragedies unfold in front of him and the game acknowledges this with the appropriate music. The game
      reflects the adversity you will face in their menu screens. For example, here is what the title screen looks and sounds like in the first game:</br></p>
<br><video width="720" height="480" controls>
  <source src="mgs1.title.screen.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></br>
    <p class="big">
    <br> Here, the title screen is action-like, hinting at what the game will be like and what it will put you through. You also get a look at Solid Snake's face, albeit not as clear with the visual effects on top,
    but you get an idea of what he looks like.</br>
    <br>Now compare the above title screen with the one below which is from the fourth installment:</br></p>
<br><video width="720" height="480" controls>
  <source src="mgs4.intro.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></br>
<br><img src="old_snake.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="Old Snake"></br>
    <p class="big">
    <br> It's a completely different mood compared to the first one. You also get a better look at Solid Snake where he appears much older than when players last saw him. In a way, the game hails the players here 
    to Snake to notice how vastly different he is now. They do so with the music that plays in the title screen, namely the soft strumming of the guitar, telling us that we are entering a different era for Snake, 
    the long journey he's been through and at the same time representing the withering life of Snake, telling the player that he might not make it this time around. To add to this, the game lets us know that this 
    game won't be like the other past games as this song plays when you start a new game:</p>
<br><audio controls>
  <source src="Love_Theme.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio></br>
    <p class="big">
    <br>While this plays in the background of the beginning cutscene, Snake explains the state of the world he's in whose economy is based on war, as we see dying militia soldiers fighting against trained military 
    troops. Althusser's <i>fort-da</i> game then becomes relevant here. As how Althusser explains that the <i>fort-da</i> game gives the illusion of mastery of control, Snake explains that war in his world has
    become fully controlled. The cutscene that plays paints a disturbing visual of the battlefield and the toll war has on the human psyche as it evokes a hopeless and depressing feeling of just how "war has changed".
    (Just a heads up, I'm including a video below that shows people dying so take this as a content warning.) Now here's the visual that accompanies the music:</p></br>

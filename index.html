    <h2>Music in <i>Metal Gear Solid 4</i></h2>
  <br>On this website, I will be talking about the role music plays in the videogame <i>Metal Gear Solid 4</i></br>
    <p class="big">
      <br>For a bit of context for the video below, past games had you play as Solid Snake, the main protagonist. 
      In those games, players saw him as a young and strong soldier taking on high risk missions to prevent world domination from corrupted forces.
      He tackles these missions with determination and accomplishes them even when the odds were against him. The game accompanied these missions with an epic and thrilling score for difficult situations the player 
      may find themselves in. But while on those missions, he is also subjected to witnessing deaths and tragedies unfold and the game acknowledges this with the appropriate music. The game even reflects the emotions
      you will face in their menu screens. For example, here is what the title screen looks like in the first game:
<br><video width="720" height="480" controls>
  <source src="mgs1.title.screen.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></br>
    <br> Here, the title screen is grand and suspenseful, hinting at what the game will put you through. You also get a look at Solid Snake's face.
      Now compare the above title screen with the one below in the fourth installment:</br></p>
<br><video width="720" height="480" controls>
  <source src="mgs4.intro.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></br>
    <br>Here is what he looks like in this game: </br>

    <h2>Short analysis of music and image in <i>Metal Gear Solid 4</i></h2>
  <br>On this website, I will be talking about how music and visuals work together in the videogame <i>Metal Gear Solid 4</i> to create powerful emotions/moods in the player.</br>
    <p class="big">
      <br>For a bit of context for the video below, past games had you play as Solid Snake, the main protagonist. 
      In those games, players saw him as a young and strong soldier taking on high risk missions to prevent world domination from corrupted forces.
      He tackles these missions with determination and accomplishes them even when the odds were against him. The game accompanied these missions with an epic and thrilling score for tense and difficult situations
      the player may find themselves in. But while on those missions, he was also subject to witnessing deaths and tragedies unfold in front of him and the game acknowledges this with the appropriate music. The game
      reflects the adversity you will face in their menu screens. For example, here is what the title screen looks and sounds like in the first game:</p></br>
<br><video width="720" height="480" controls>
  <source src="mgs1.title.screen.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></br>
    <p class="big">
    <br> Here, the title screen is action-like, hinting at what the game will be like and what it will put you through. You also get a look at Solid Snake's face, albeit not as clear with the visual effects on top,
    but you get an idea of what he looks like.</br>
    <br>Now compare the above title screen with the one below which is from the fourth installment:</p></br>
<br><video width="720" height="480" controls>
  <source src="mgs4.intro.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></br>
<br><img src="old_snake.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="Old Snake"></br>
    <p class="big">
    <br> It's a completely different mood compared to the first one. You also get a better look at Solid Snake where he appears much older than when players last saw him. In a way, the game implicitly hails players here 
    to Snake and how vastly different he is now (note 1). They do so with the music that plays in the title screen, namely the soft strumming of the guitar, telling us that we are entering a different era for Snake, reminding us of 
    the long journey he's been through and at the same time representing the withering life of Snake, telling us that he might not make it this time around. The game wants us to feel for Snake through our emotions
    by playing soft music on top of the beautiful visual, that being Snake in a cemetary as petals fall all around him. To add to this, the game lets us know that this game won't be like the other past games as this 
    song plays when you start up a new game:</p></br>
<br><audio controls>
  <source src="Love_Theme.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio></br>
    <p class="big">
    <br>When you start up the game, Snake narrates and explains the state of the world he's in, as we see dying militia soldiers fighting against trained military troops, whilst the song plays in the background.
    Freud's <i>fort-da</i> game becomes relevant here (note 2). Just as Freud explains that the <i>fort-da</i> game gives the illusion of mastery of control, Snake explains that war in his world has essentially
    become a game of <i>fort-da</i>, giving the soldiers the illusion that they have everything under total control.</br>
    <br>(There's even a boss in the game that can fully control other people including Snake like marionettes!
    When Snake dies, you can briefly see strings that appear above him, almost like we weren't in full control of him, giving US the illusion of control.)</br>
    
    <br>The cutscene that plays paints a disturbing visual of the battlefield and the toll war has on humans as it evokes a hopeless and depressing feeling of just how "war has changed".
    Now here's the visual that accompanies the music:(Just a heads up, the video below will show the dying soldiers as described above so take this as a content warning!)</p></br>
<br><video width="720" height="480" controls>

    <p class="big">
    <br>Here, both image and sound come together to create a depressing mood in <i>Metal gear Solid 4</i>.</p></br>

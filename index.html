  <h2>Music in <i>Metal Gear Solid 4</i></h2>
<br>On this website, I will be talking about the role music plays in the videogame <i>Metal Gear Solid 4</i></br>
    <br>For a bit of context for the video below, past games had you play as Solid Snake, the main protagonist. 
    In those games, players saw him as a young and strong soldier taking on high risk missions to prevent world domination from corrupted forces.
    He tackles these missions with determination and accomplishes them even when the odds were against him. The game accompanied these missions with an epic and thrilling score for difficult situations the player 
    may find themselves in. But while on those missions, he is also subjected to witnessing deaths and tragedies unfold and the game acknowledges this with the appropriate music. In the end, the game establishes
    what Snake went through in those games with this title screen in the fourth installment:</br>

    <br>In this game, he is much older than when players last saw him.</br>
